Generate an image from a tweet, so that it can be easier to share! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

this project uses twitter embed public API, so there is **no need for apiKey** or such thing. it is running on a **netlify serverless funciton** and uses *puppeteer* to open the embed page and take a *screenshot*.

## Usage

copy link of a tweet and place at the end:

```
https://tweet2img.netlify.app/img?url=<HERE>
```

example of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Mehdi70501002/status/1262117721090785280):
